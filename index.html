        <h1>Destruction, Devastation and Death - The Effect Of Conflicts</h1>

        <p id = "intro">
            “If we don't end war, war will end us” is something our team stands by. It was 8 years ago when the world saw the devastating effects of the Vietnam war, which were conveyed to totality through the picture of the Napalm girl, a girl so vulnerable, so powerless, yearning for help; there is someone like her in every town, every village where war takes place, and it is our aim to help as many of them as possible, something which can only happen with your help. Through extensive research our team has come to the conclusion that a wide spectrum is affected by war, from rich to poor, or young to old, everyone faces different struggles and hardships, and our aim is to help them in the most suitable and efficient way possible. In this webpage we provide you with an immense amount of information on the varying struggles faced by different stakeholders, and how everyone perceives the damage the war does in different ways. In the end we provide you with a multitude of ways in which you can help them, and make a huge difference in their lives, something greatly appreciable.

                <h3>People with disabilities</h3>
                <p>People with disabilities are among the people most at risk during conflicts and wars. “Just as women and children are uniquely affected by conflict and displacement, people with disabilities face special challenges when their lives are suddenly uprooted because of war,” said Shantha Rau Barriga. An estimated 9.7 million people with disabilities are forcibly displaced as a result of conflict and are victims of human rights violations and conflict-related violence. Some people, particularly disabled women and girls, are physically unable to flee violence, therefore, they face, sexual, verbal, physical and mental abuse. Blind people also require constant help to be rescued and taken to safety. Similarly, deaf people cannot hear and understand the cause and the escalation of the war. For instance, a 43-year-old man was shot in the conflict in Cameroon when he did not respond to the questions of the enemies because he was deaf.</p>

                <h3>Age</h3>
                <p>Young- Wars terribly affect the innocent lives of children. They affect children in all the ways they affect adults. Hundreds of thousands of children either die or suffer a range of injuries due to violence in war each year. Children are exposed to situations of terror and horror during the war which makes them experience long-term stress and anxiety disorder.
                <br>
                Middle-aged- Death, injury, sexual violence, malnutrition, illness, and disability are some of the most threatening physical consequences that wars have on people while post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety are some of the emotional effects that disturb the lives of people.
                <br>
                Old- Old-aged people predominantly suffer mental trauma from wars. Some of them are left behind by their families and are eventually killed in the war.

            <h3>Women</h3>
            <p>Women are one of the most vulnerable groups of people affected by the war, as their rights are violated, they are stripped of their dignity, something we must put an end to. Attackers target women particularly because of their gender. Women and girls caught in the middle of war experience sexual violence, various kinds of abuse, and barriers in accessing basic necessities; this is on top of being directly exposed to conflict on the front lines and facing life-threatening conditions. Moreover, War and GBV are undeniably interlinked, with women being exposed to physical, verbal, sexual, and psychological abuse in times of conflict. This form of violence is also used as a tool in war to assert control, weaken families, carry out ethnic cleansings and genocide, and to discourage resistance, and destabilize communities. The struggle faced by these women cannot be described in words, and we need to provide them with help in every way possible.

            <h3>Financial Background</h3>
            <p>Rich: Even though one may think that the rich don't face as many problems as the others during the war, they are about to be proved wrong once they read about the struggles they face, and will realize that they are just as vulnerable as anyone else. Vulnerability to being targeted by violence (for example, due to ethnicity) can also make even well-off households vulnerable to poverty, as was the case in Rwanda, proving that the rich aren't prone to the devastation caused by war. At times of war, the poor group of people is given numerous facilities by the government as they need them most however very few provisions are given to the rich people as the government presumes that the rich people already have enough resources and money to secure themselves which may not always be the case and which may lead to their lives becoming miserable. In addition to that, due to increased tax rates during the war, a lot of burdens come on the lives of rich people as they are charged the most. 

            Poor: During times of war the lives of poor people start going downhill, from bad to worse. Even though they are given aid by people around the world and support from the government, they still have to face multiple challenges. Once the war begins, it hits the poor the hardest. Social welfare is depleted as goods and services are diverted to the war effort; rural infrastructure is destroyed in contested territory; and justice and security provision retracts into urban areas and elite enclaves. Conflict causes and compounds poverty.

            <h3>Minorities</h3>
            <p>Minorities are one of the most vulnerable stakeholders of conflicts. They are already very small in numbers and often face discrimination because of their caste, nationality, gender, or race. As a result, they are often left behind and are not provided with facilities that the general public is provided with. Even though they are discriminated against in their daily lives, the amount increases a lot during the war, since Conflict and transitions can also further negatively affect minorities by dividing them. Furthermore, they also suffer from a lack of security as they have different identities and their small number relative to the rest of the society develops feelings of insecurity about their life, assets, and well-being. This lack of security is perilous during the time of war and conflict as the situation is already very turbulent</p>

            <h3>Areas where people live</h3>
            <p>People living in urban areas are at more of a disadvantage than people living in rural areas. There are many factories in Urban areas which have a lot of hazardous equipment in them, which may drastically impact the city if they come in contact with fire that happens during war, which may lead to explosions; ultimately leading to a significant loss in life. Aggressive countries often target cities, as they are densely populated and as mentioned in the above point have factories, a lot of electricity generators, and sometimes even nuclear reactors in rare cases, which can lead to huge explosions if targeted by missiles or any other form of firepower, hence the battles are mainly fought on Urban grounds which makes the people living they're prone to danger. Logic follows that where there are more people and more weapons, there are more victims. An overwhelming percentage of people killed or injured by explosive weapons in populated areas are civilians. Civilians, not military targets. These are people who are not taking part in the conflict. They are mothers and fathers and children who are not part of the fight and simply wish to lead their lives without the constant threat of bombs or gunfire. These people mostly need help in evacuating.

        <p>
            In these times of turbulence, it is of great importance that we help these people because they are facing circumstances one can only imagine. One of the ways in which you can help them is by donating money through the fundraiser that we have created. It doesn't matter how much one donates, but with the intentions with which they do. Furthermore, you can also help raise awareness about people facing different struggles due to these preposterous wars that take place every year and kill millions of people, and inform everyone in your community of this, as if we don't help them who will? Additionally, you can read about the ordeal that these people go through on various sites as we will paste at the end of these pages, and give away various assets like bandages, food, sanitary items, etc, through sites like https://www.rescue.org/. 
            
            Moreover, avoiding circulating fake news on the internet can also help prevent  prejudices against these people. Steps could be taken to prevent circulation of news which is often used for spreading hate, misleading people and other negative effects by relevant national bodies.
